# CoManagement GPO WMI Filters

If you have Hybrid AAD Joined devices that are co-managed, GPOs apply regardless of the co-management workload configuration. This project aims to create easy importable GPO WMI Filter mof files for Co-Management workloads for each workload and its workload config (Intune / ConfigMgr).

**⚠️ This is a POC, WMI Filters may impact the GPO processing time**
